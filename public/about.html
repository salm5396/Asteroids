		<h3>Personal Information</h3>
		<p id = "vinhDescription">Hello there! My name is Vinh Nguyen and I am currently a junior at the University of St. Thomas studying computer science. Originally from Massachusetts I came all the way to Minnesota for college. Some of my interest include sports and food. Fun fact about me is that I can juggle pretty well. Not only spheres but really just about anything that won't hurt me if I hold it. Also know how to work with Devil Sticks and use to dabble with Diabolo (the big yoyo).
		That is a little bit about me, hope you enjoy playing the game!
